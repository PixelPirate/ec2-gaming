# Start the Windows Audio Service

## Enable Sound

By default, Windows Server 2012 has disabled audio because probably most servers wonâ€™t need it. This page will help you to enable audio in Windows Server 2012.

Open the `Start` screen, click `Administrative Tools` and open the `Services` shortcut. Next, double click the `Windows Audio` service and set its `Startup type` to `Automatic`. Repeat this process for the `Windows Audio Endpoint Builder` service. If you want to use audio immediately, also click the `Start` button in the Properties window of both services in addition to changing the Startup type.
